# Memorize-Game
This project is written in Python. Once the game starts, the game engine generates a pattern of 4 random numbers which must be memorized by the user. 
As the user achieves to remember the correct number pattern, it passes the corresponding level in which the game engine generates another pattern, 
the total size of this pattern is one more than the previous one. This cycle continues forever, unless the user commits mistake.
